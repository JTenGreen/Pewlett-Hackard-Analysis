# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview:
During this analysis we created 2 tables, one to determine which employees are eligible to enter a mentorship program and the other to determine the number of retiring employees alongisde their titles.


Results:
 -Out of 90,398 retiring employees, 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff are retiring, which are the vast mayority and should be prioritized.
 
 -There are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program.

-There is a very minimal number of eligible employees to enter the mentorship program compared to the total number of retiring employees.


Summary:
More lenient requierements can be put in place to add more retiring employees into the mentorship program to train and make the transition smoother for the company.
A single mentor could also harbor a larger group of mentees in order to assist with the lack of mentors.
The employees who are retiring where born from 1952 to 1955 the age to qualify for a retirement is 67, we could phase in a hiring quota over the next 4 years to also mitigate the sudden loss of employees.
